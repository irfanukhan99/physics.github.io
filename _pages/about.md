As a PhD student in Theoretical Particle Physics at the University of Southampton, I am pursuing my passion for understanding the fundamental nature of reality. I am working on research projects involving gauge theories and supersymmetry, using advanced mathematical tools such as group theory and differential geometry.

Before my PhD, I was doing an integrated Master's at the University of Leeds. During my time in Leeds, I developed a fascination with continuous symmetries through Noether's theorem. This led me down the path of (Supersymmetric Field Theories)[https://www.academia.edu/117471881/Supersymmetic_Field_Theories_The_N_1_Wonderland] and I gained deeper insight into Lie groups and their algebras. In particular, Graded Lie Algebras and their representation in superspace.

I have also been a part-time tutor at Lextra Learning since Nov 2019, where I help students achieve their academic goals in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Physics. I prepare them for A-level exams and Cambridge STEP entry exams, using my strong background and experience in these subjects. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm for physics and mathematics with my students and enabling them to develop their skills and confidence.
